FOREX FACTORY CREDIT APP CRUD Sample 
------------------------------------

This is a example to create a application for CRUD by using MVC design pattern,PDO extension, Jquery and Twitter Bootstrap.
using JSON as data-interchange format for HTTP request and response.

It has very little error checking and I kind of ran outta gas when it came to hitting an external REST server for the credit score update..
mainly because I can't just stick a demo server anywhere without serious security issues.

It was created on 11/16/13 and is solely my work (with some help from my friends at StackExchange :)

The "credit reporting" database currently has "scores" for these "ssn-s"
987654321
123456789
112233445
554433221
123234345
987876765
111111111
222222222
333333333
444444444
555555555
666666666
777777777
888888888
999999999

It currently does NOT check names, only match SSN's...error checking for this sort of thing is pretty trival.
